# RahatAI - Quick Summary

## What is This Project?

**RahatAI** = Crisis Response AI System

**Purpose:** Help during disasters by understanding crisis messages in English, Urdu, and Roman-Urdu.

---

## What Does It Do? (6 Main Things)

1. **Classifies** crisis messages → "Help Request", "Offer", "Report", etc.
2. **Answers questions** → Uses RAG to find answers in crisis documents
3. **Extracts info** → Finds locations, phone numbers, resources
4. **Summarizes** → Creates short summaries of many posts
5. **Detects lies** → Identifies false/misleading information
6. **Evaluates** → Measures how well everything works

## How Many Models?

**5 Classification Models:**
1. Naive Bayes (Done)
2. SVM (Done)
3. LSTM (Training now)
4. CNN (Waiting)
5. Transformer (Waiting)

---

## What's Done?

- Data prepared
- 2 models trained (Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Evaluation system ready
- Project structure organized

## What's Left?

- 1 model training (LSTM - in progress)
- 2 more models (CNN, Transformer)
- RAG setup
- NER, Summarization, Misinformation

**Total Tasks Remaining: ~30 tasks**

## How to Present?

### Simple Way (Recommended):
1. Create PowerPoint
2. Show problem → solution → results
3. Include plots and examples
4. Keep it simple (10-15 slides)

### Files Created for You:
- `Docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Complete explanation
- `Docs/TASK_CHECKLIST.md` - What to do next
- `Docs/PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md` - How to present

---

## Next Steps:

1. **Wait** for LSTM to finish
2. **Train** CNN (30-40 min)
3. **Train** Transformer (1-2 hours)
4. **Set up** RAG
5. **Create** presentation

---

## Key Files:

- `main.py` - Run everything
- `RunScripts/STEP*.py` - Step-by-step scripts
- `config/config.yaml` - All settings
- `Docs/` - All documentation

---

## Remember:

- **Simple is better** - Don't overcomplicate
- **Show results** - Plots and examples are powerful
- **Compare models** - Show which is best
- **Real examples** - Use actual crisis posts
- **Practice** - Rehearse your presentation

**You've got this!**
